                <p>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.</p>

                <h3>Photo Two</h3>
                <p>The physical world and the inner soul constitute nature, the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components. But, deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature.</p>

                <p>Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked.</p>

                <h3>Photo Four</h3>
                <p>For all of us, nature is crucial. It’s the reason for the existence of life on this planet. Nature is home to many different creatures. All living organisms benefit from the natural balance maintained by Mother Nature. The study of the natural environment is a separate discipline of science. </p>

                <p>Nature is the connection between the physical world surrounding us and the life inside us. Nature is God’s most precious and valuable gift to humans. It is the principal source of all essential nutrients for all living things on the planet. </p>
